Grease two 9-inch round cake pans and line the bottom with parchment paper then grease the top of the paper. Or, grease and flour the bottom and sides of both pans. In a medium bowl, whisk flour, baking soda, salt, and the cinnamon until well blended. In a separate bowl, whisk the oil, sugars, and vanilla. Whisk in eggs, one at a time, until combined. Switch to a large rubber spatula. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl then add the dry ingredients in 3 parts, gently stirring until they disappear and the batter is smooth. Stir in the carrots, nuts, and raisins. Divide the batter between the prepared cake pans. Bake until the tops of the cake layers are springy when touched and when a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes. Cool cakes in pans for 15 minutes then turn out onto cooling racks, peel off parchment paper and cool completely. (If you find that a cake layer is stuck to the bottom of the pan, leave the cake pan upside down and allow gravity to do its thing). In a large bowl, beat cream cheese with a handheld mixer on medium speed until creamy, about 1 minute. Beat in the powdered sugar, a 1/4 cup at a time until fluffy. Pour in cream and beat on medium speed for 1 minute. Chill covered until ready to frost cake. When the cake layers are completely cool, frost the top of one cake layer, place the other cake layer on top. Decoratively swirl the top of the cake with remaining frosting, leaving the sides unfrosted.

Set multifunction cooker to Saute (or set a nonstick skillet on high heat). Spray it with olive oil, then add in the roast. Sear on both sides for 2 to 3 minutes. If you are cooking in a skillet, add the roast to the pressure cooker (or slow cooker). Add the remaining ingredients to the pressure cooker, give it a quick stir, then place on the lid and cook for 20 to 25 minutes. (Note: adjust the cooking time according to the instructions on your pressure cooker) If you do not have a pressure cooker, use a slow cooker. Cook on low for 6 to 8 hours. Release the pressure, then gently pull apart the meat or cut it up on a plate. Then, add it back to the broth of the pressure cooker to marinate and meld. Whipped Parsnips Preparation Chop parsnips into small 1.5 cm pieces. The best way is to chop them horizontally, then cut those chunks into halves or quarters depending on their size. The middle part of parsnips tend to be tough so you cut them up like this to ensure the middle part softens as well. Bring a pot of water to a boil, then toss in parsnips. Boil for 15 to 20 minutes, until they can easily be pierced with a fork. Drain them and allow them to cool. Place the parsnips in a food processor along with the rest of the ingredients. Blend until smooth. Season to taste with sea salt & pepper. Cook asparagus or your favorite green veggies, then evenly divide everything among your meal containers.
